# Message Librarian
### Overview
Developed with the [Qt 5.6 C++ Toolkit](https://www.qt.io/), _Message Librarian_ is a simple desktop application for managing collections of printed and audio material. It combines a simple table view with an Edit dialog for managing entries.

### Current Features
* Document attachements - Each entry may have outside files attached, which provides easy retrieval for further processing. Originally conceived for managing audio sermon libraries, this feature wil also work well for managing pictures, PDFs, and many other document types.
* Multi-column Search - The regular expression-based search engine allows users to search the database by type of metadata. Combining multiple columns for complex search patterns is specifically supported.

### Roadmap
Expect to see a list of future development goals here soon. I need feedback from the potential userbase on what features are most important. The original design of this application was solely for managing audio sermons. If the demand increases for support of other types of document organization, we may pursue a modularized approach, with specific processors for different document types.

The MIT license is by definition a [permissive license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license). This means you can basically do anything you want with the source code and the binaries of any project licensed in this manner. However, its authors are exempted from all liability for the use of their software. The GPL and the LGPL licenses, on the other hand, specifically prohibit the commercial relicensing of any projects licensed under them. [Here](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-gpl-and-lgpl/) is a good article describing the difference between these two licenses.

How does this licensing affect the end users of this project? For those of you with the experience to do so, you are freely permitted to rebuild the Message Librarian source and distribute the binaries for money or for free, as long as you include the above mentioned licenses. However, while you may relicense the Message Librarian code commercially, you are strictly prohibited from doing this with the Qt libraries it links against. Furthermore, all modifications to this project shall retain the public user message indicating the Qt dependencies and their respective licenses.

### Download
This project needs a little more fine-tuning before I am ready to offer a public download link. Included in this is making sure that offering seemless updates is possible and that the basic feature set is reliable.

### Get Involved
This project has been simmering on the back burner for several years, and has weathered long periods of total neglect. However, with the encouragement of several of my friends who knew about this project, I have decided to open source it to generate more interest and feedback.
If you wish to contribute with actual code, contact me and we can discuss the best way to move forward. Please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Stanley-G/message-librarian/issues/new) to start discussion on a feature that you would like to see.
