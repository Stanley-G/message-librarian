# Message Librarian
### Overview
Based on the [Qt 5.6 C++ Toolkit](https://www.qt.io/), _Message Librarian_ is a simple desktop application for managing collections of printed and audio material. It combines a simple table view with an Edit dialog for managing entries.

Current Features:
* Document attachements - Each entry may have outside files attached, which provides easy retrieval for further processing. Originally conceived for managing audio sermon libraries, this feature wil also work well for managing pictures, PDFs, and many other document types.
* Multi-column Search - The regular expression-based search engine allows users to search the metadata by type of metadata. Combining multiple columns for complex search patterns is specifically supported.

### Roadmap
Expect to see a list of future development goals here soon. I need feedback from the potential userbase on what features are most important. The original design of this application was solely for managing audio sermons. If the demand increases for support of other types of document organization, we may pursue a modularized approach, with specific processors for different document types.

### Get involved
This project has been simmering on the back burner for several years, and has weathered long periods of total neglect. However, with the encouragement of several of my friends who know about this project, I have decided to open source it to generate more interest and feedback.
If you wish to contribute with actual code, contact me and we can discuss the best way to move forward.
